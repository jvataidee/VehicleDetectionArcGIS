# Vehicle Detection with ArcGIS

This repository houses the work for my thesis for the specialization in geoprocessing and georeferencing at UFERSA, where I trained a model for vehicle detection and counting directly in ArcGIS Pro. The project is divided into several steps, each represented by a Jupyter notebook:

1. [`estabilizing.ipynb`](https://github.com/jvataidee/VehicleDetectionArcGIS/blob/master/estabilizing.ipynb): This notebook likely involves the initial data processing and stabilization needed to prepare for the machine learning phase.
2. [`training_model_tracking_fasterRCNN.ipynb`](https://github.com/jvataidee/VehicleDetectionArcGIS/blob/master/training_model_tracking_fasterRCNN.ipynb): This notebook is likely where the machine learning model is trained. It probably involves loading the data, creating the model, and training the model using the data.
3. [`application.ipynb`](https://github.com/jvataidee/VehicleDetectionArcGIS/blob/master/vehicle_detection_deploy.ipynb): This notebook probably demonstrates how to use the trained model to detect and count vehicles in new, unseen images.

## Background
